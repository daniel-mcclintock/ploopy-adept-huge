Ploopy Adept + Elecom Huge == Ploopy Adept Huge

 - A janky and lazy retrofit of the Ploopy Adept to fit an Elecom Huge sized ball(~52mm).
 - Static bearing adapters included, use them if you don't want to risk scratching the soft Elecom ball's surface. Yes you will get stiction.

 - Stiction sucks.
